### abstract: |
  | \vspace*{1cm}\footnotesize Vaccination is regarded as the single most cost-effective preventive health intervention to date. Like other health interventions, it should be understood beyond the direct health benefits as an economic investment with vast and long-lasting social and financial returns. In this study, we focus on outcome-related productivity gains, estimating the causal effect of measles vaccination on educational attainment. We analyze the introduction of the second dose of measles-containing vaccine in India through a phased catch-up campaign conducted in high-priority states from 2010 to 2013. Our results suggest that measles vaccination significantly increases educational attainment for children aged 6 to 14. For every four children vaccinated an additional school year is gained. The study demonstrates that measles vaccination can be understood beyond the direct health benefits as an investment in human capital.
